         <h1>Josh Keller</h1>
         
         <p>I lead visual coverage for the international desk of The New York Times. I work with a team of journalists based around the world to find original approaches to the largest global news stories — a multidisciplinary group that includes reporters, designers, developers, chartmakers and mapmakers.</p></p>
         
         <p>I have a particular interest in communicating complex subjects by marrying writing and visual explanations. We have investigated and diagrammed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/31/world/europe/bayesian-yacht-sinking-italy.html">why an “unsinkable” superyacht sank</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html">how Covid spread</a> in the early days of the pandemic, how wealth changes your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/asia/india-pollution-inequality.html">exposure to air pollution in New Delhi</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/16/world/europe/notre-dame.html">why Notre Dame went up in flames</a>. This work is as much about creative forms of reporting (finding things out) as it is about memorable forms of presentation (showing what we find).</p>
         
         <p>I have edited stories that have been a part of four Pulitzer Prizes awarded to The Times, on Covid (2020), Ukraine (2021), Israel/Gaza (2022), and Sudan (2024). Before joining The Times, I wrote about colleges for The Chronicle of Higher Education and ran a small web design company in San Francisco.</p>
